# Natural Language Processing 

This repository contains the source code for a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Model for the Google QUEST Q&A Labeling competition on Kaggle.com. 
Here is link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/google-quest-challenge/

The source code conatins:
- _google_qa.ipynb_ - a Jupyter notebook file that contains the outputs for our model
- _train.csv_ - dataset from the competition to train the model
- _test.csv_ - dataset from the competition  to test the model
